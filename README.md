# GMBN-Demo (YouTube Data API v3 Demo)

This simple android application gives a demo of some of the google cloud apis we can use to obtain detailed youtube data of an individual channel or details about 
a specific videos using specific playlist id and video id. This is developed using MVVM architecture using Kotlin, 
Dagger for dependency injection, Coroutines for API loading interface and using the Paging library 3.
I have used the PagingDataAdapter along with data(sometimes viewModel) binding.
